## Quick Notes

* This is the first piece of software that I have publicly released, there are bound to be mistakes and pieces of code that aren't "professional" or whatever you want to say.
* The name 'Pootis-Bot' was suggested by my friend. Yes, I know what game it is from, I play it!
* The robot heavy icon is Valve Corporationâ€™s model.
* Thanks for Discord for generaly being awesome (most of the time).
