Example: A new user would join your server but they would have to first react to a message with a spefic emoji. Setup Message First off you would need a message. This message can be from anyone in any channel. It can even be a embed message say from the command embed that bot features. It is recommand to have this message in its own channel such as a #rules channel that basiclly any public server has, with permission that no on (except you of course) can write to it, but can still react in it (important). Now you need to get the message ID. Follow this guide to learn how get into developer mode. Hover over the message you want to get the ID of, then next to were you would react to a message, click on on the three little dots -> Copy ID. Here what it should look like. Once you got that ID of the message you want to use, run the command: setuprulesmessage [ID] But instead of [ID] you would put the ID we copyed. Example: setuprulesmessage 487951616666763274 Choosing an emoji Once you have done that now its time for our emoji. Go to this site and pick out an emoji. For this example I will choose \ud83d\ude04(grinning face with smiling eyes) After that you need to run setupruleemoji [emoji] So mine would be setupruleemoji \ud83d\ude04 The emoji can't be the one in the Discord format, it must be unicode! \ud83d\ude04 would acually be :simle: in Discord but due to way the bot works :simle: won't work! The bot does check for this and will tell you! It is allso a good idea to put in that message that you need to react to this message with this emoji. E.G: React with \ud83d\ude04 to gain access to the server once you have read the rules! Setting up an role The second last thing is to set up a role. This role should be your base role. Create a new role like normal, but make it like a generic role. A standard role for new users. Give it permissions to access the channels that people who have reacted to the message can access. Once you have done that change the @everyone role to only have access to the channel that the message is contained in and that they can react to the message. This example it will be called Member Once you have your role done that, do the command: setuprulerole [role] So for our example it would be: setuprulerole Member Enabling / Disabling rule reaction To enable the rule reaction feature, you must have done the previous steps, after that do the command: togglerulereaction Assuming everything is correct it all should work. If a new user joins that should only have access to the channels that you specified until they react on that message with that specific emoji.
