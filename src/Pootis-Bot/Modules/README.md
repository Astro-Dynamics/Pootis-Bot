# Modules

For Pootis-Bot Discord command modules, we have a bit of a guide-line for them, so please read ALL of this so you know how Pootis-Bot modules are set up!

## Module Information header

At the start of all Discord Command Modules we have this header. Here is the template:

```csharp
// Module Information
// Original Author  - [Original Author Name]
// Description      - [Basic Description on what the module does]
// Contributors     - [List of all contributors]
```

If you want more examples see one of the pre existing modules in the project.

## Each Section Meaning

### Original Author

The original creator of the module, if you are creating a new module put your name here! If you are modifying a module, DON'T TOUCH IT.

### Description

Provide a basic description on what the module is meant to do.

### Contributors

If you change a module in any way, put your name in this list, also if you are creating a new module put your name here as well!
