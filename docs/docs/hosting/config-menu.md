# Config Menu

Pootis-Bot comes with a config menu that you can use to easily edit the bot's config. It provides controls for most setting that you may want to edit. Additional customization can be done by editing the `Config.json` file, typically located in the `Resources/` directory. Here you get access to each key. Read the [Config file](../../dev/config-file/) for more information.

Here is what the config menu, by default, looks like.

You can access each corresponding section by entering the number next to it. For example, to edit the token you would enter in '1'. It will then ask you for your Discord API token.

You can access the config menu any time using the console by using the command:
```bat
config
```
