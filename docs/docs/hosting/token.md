# Getting a Token

For your bot to work, or any Discord bot, you need something from Discord called a 'Token'.

Creating/getting one is easy.

## Creating a Discord App

First, head to [this page](https://discord.com/developers), and make sure you are signed into Discord in the browser.

You will land on a page that looks something like this:
![Main-App-Page](../../assets/images/App-Creation/1-Main-App-Page.jpg)

Yours may not look the same, as I have some other applications.

After you are on that page, click on 'New Application' in the top right corner.

You will get a menu open up like this:

![App-Name](../../assets/images/App-Creation/2-App-Name.jpg)

Give your application a name and click 'Create'.

After that you should be on a page that looks like this:
![App-Main-Page](../../assets/images/App-Creation/3-App-Main-Page.jpg)

Give it an icon and a description if you want to right now.

### Creating the bot account

On the main app page, click 'Bot' on the left hand side panel.

You will be greeted with this:
![Bot-Main-Page](../../assets/images/App-Creation/4-Bot-Creation.jpg)

After that click 'Add Bot' on the right. It will come up with a pop up saying are you sure you want to create it, click 'yes'.

Ta-da! Your wild bot has been created!

## Getting the token

Its easy, just click 'Click to Reveal Token' and it will reveal the token of your bot.

!!! warning
    DO NOT GIVE YOUR BOT TOKEN TO ANYONE YOU DON'T TRUST!
    
    The token allows anyone to control the bot and could be used to reek disaster
    in the guilds that it is in!
