To add a user as an owner, execute the command:

```

For example, if you wanted to add the user 'John Smith' as an owner, you would do:
```bash
setup add guildowner John Smith
```

### Removing an user

To remove an user as an owner, execute the command:
```bash
setup add guildowner [user]
```

So if you wanted to remove 'John Smith' as an owner, you would do:
```bash
setup add guildowner John Smith
```
